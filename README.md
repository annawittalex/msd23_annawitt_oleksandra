# CalculatorSys
##### *simple oparations with numbers*
---

CalculatorSys is a java program which is intended to read the required three values directly from the command line and inform the user accordingly if an incorrect entry was made. The entries should be structured as follows:
* Value 1: {User input} 
* Operator: {User input} 
* Value 2: {User input}

## Installation
---
In order to run this program the following tools are needed:

- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: This is *essential* for compiling Java source code into bytecode and executing Java applications. Important is to check if Java Runtime Environment (JRE) and Java compiler (javac) are included in the installation.

- **Integrated Development Environment (IDE)** (*recommended*): While you can write Java code in a simple text editor like Notepad and compile it using command-line tools, an IDE provides a more convenient and productive environment for development. Popular choices include **IntelliJ IDEA**, **Eclipse**, and **NetBeans**.

Text Editor or IDE: If you prefer not to use a full-fledged IDE, you can use a text editor like Sublime Text, Visual Studio Code, or Atom for writing Java code.

## Usage
---
The user is asked to make the following entries through the console:
* Value 1: {User input} 
* Operator: {User input} 
* Value 2: {User input}

Value 1 and Value 2 are floating point numbers (only positive numbers should be accepted) and the operator can only be one of the four basic calculation types (*, +, -, /). If a correct entry has been made, the program should output the calculation as a result(see example). In addition, the program should check the correctness of the entry of all values and output appropriate messages in the event of an error.

**Example**
```java
Value 1:what
Please enter a non-negative valid double!
Value 1:-3
Please enter a non-negative valid double!
Value 1:3
Operator:+
Value 2:2
3.00+2.00 = 5.00
```
